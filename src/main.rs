    // GPIO pins on the STM32F1 must be driven by the APB2 peripheral clock.
    // This must be enabled first. The HAL provides some abstractions for
    // us: First get a handle to the RCC peripheral:
    let mut rcc = dp.RCC;
    rcc.cr.write(|w| w.hseon().set_bit());
    while dp.RCC.cr.read().hserdy().bit() {}
    // Now we have access to the RCC's registers. The GPIOC can be enabled in
    // RCC_APB2ENR (Prog. Ref. Manual 8.3.7), therefore we must pass this
    // register to the `split` function.

    let mut gpioc = dp.GPIOC.
    // This gives us an exclusive handle to the GPIOC peripheral. To get the
    // handle to a single pin, we need to configure the pin first. Pin C13
    // is usually connected to the Bluepills onboard LED.

    // Now we need a delay object. The delay is of course depending on the clock
    // frequency of the microcontroller, so we need to fix the frequency
    // first. The system frequency is set via the FLASH_ACR register, so we
    // need to get a handle to the FLASH peripheral first:
    let mut flash = dp.FLASH.constrain();
    // Now we can set the controllers frequency to 8 MHz:
    let clocks = rcc.cfgr.sysclk(8.mhz()).freeze(&mut flash.acr);
    // The `clocks` handle ensures that the clocks are now configured and gives
    // the `Delay::new` function access to the configured frequency. With
    // this information it can later calculate how many cycles it has to
    // wait. The function also consumes the System Timer peripheral, so that no
    // other function can access it. Otherwise the timer could be reset during a
    // delay.
    let mut delay = Delay::new(cp.SYST, clocks);
